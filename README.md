Raid Road is a 2D video game made with Java. The end goal is to have a functional and fun game that includes levels of increasing difficulty where you fight of endless hoards of mobs(kind of like Vampire Survivors) and have to reach a certain pre-determined goal to pass the level while being able to get new items, gear and powerups from NPCs and other locations on the map.  <br />
